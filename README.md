# hello-world
This is me doing a thing - check it out, yo!

I'm doing this because I want to learn about/how-to code(ing) with python!

Also, a breif story about myself.

From the young age of 11 years old, just before I was bitten by a wolf spider in the face,
I developed a keen sense of what I wanted to do when I grew up. Now, I know my true purpose!
To become the only human being to, LEFT-HANDEDLY, find a better combination of condiments
than peanut butter and jelly between two slices of white bread!

Wish me luck, ten-speed, god's blood, and burial.
